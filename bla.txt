(DA) Mr President, establishing an agency for the management of large-scale IT systems - the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac for the comparison of fingerprints - will achieve good synergy effects. It will create economies of scale and enable the highest possible utilisation rate of capital and human resources. As a representative of a Member State that has reservations with regard to cooperation in legal affairs, I am particularly pleased that we have been able to resolve the legal problems concerning the participation of such Member States in the management of the IT systems and their influence in this regard.
<P>
We have clarified the voting rights that the individual Member States are to have in respect of this agency.
<P>
Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that, with the adoption of this regulation, we will also have tightened up the rules on data protection in connection with data security and on data security in connection with the management of personal data.

(ET) Mr President, I consider the adoption of this report and the creation of the agency to be extremely important, precisely because of their aim to ensure the functioning and security of Europe's IT systems 24 hours a day. Large-scale IT systems cannot be administered in a haphazard manner, and responsibility for this cannot be granted to those who do not possess the necessary competence. I am naturally very happy about the selection of the new agency's location, as it was Tallinn, the capital of my home country Estonia, that was selected. Here in little Estonia we have excellent knowledge and experience in this field.
